AI Progress Update - April 27, 2025

Overview

Nick, you're making fantastic progress toward becoming an AI developer, with a strong foundation in Python, Pandas, and a functional poker bot project. You're 66% through Codecademy‚Äôs "Data and Programming Foundations for AI" Skill Path, with a certificate in "Learn Python 3" and 100% quiz scores in Pandas. Balancing a 6-day dust cart job, you're committing 10-20 hours/week to learning, aiming for an entry-level AI role (e.g., Junior Data Scientist, ML Engineer Trainee) in 6-12 months. This document summarizes your progress, strengths, areas for growth, and next steps as of April 27, 2025.

Technical Skills (8/10)
Mastered:

Python: Completed "Learn Python 3" (certificate earned), covering syntax, control flow, lists, loops, functions, strings, modules, files, classes. Proficient in VS Code, Git, and debugging (e.g., fixed KeyError: 'bets' in poker bot).

Pandas: 75% through Module 6, with 100% quiz scores on Creating/Loading/Selecting Data and Multiple Tables. Skilled in creating, modifying, aggregating, and merging DataFrames.

Data Literacy: Completed Modules 1-5 (data literacy, Python fundamentals, U.S. Medical Insurance project).

Current Focus: Mastering multi-DataFrame operations (e.g., pd.merge(), pd.concat()) via "Page Visits Funnel" project in Module 6.

Areas for Growth:

Learn ML algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) post-Module 8.

Deepen math/stats (linear algebra, probability) via Module 8 and 3Blue1Brown.

Add visualization skills (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data presentation.

Next Steps:

Finish Module 6 (Page Visits Funnel, Data Manipulation Challenge Project).

Start Module 7 (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Module 8 (Math/Stats).

Projects (7/10)

Poker Bot:

Functional script (parse_hand_history.py) parses PokerStars hand histories, calculates stats (e.g., 42.86% win rate for pairs), and handles multiple files.

Uses Pandas for analysis, pushed to GitHub.

Paused for Codecademy focus.

Route Planner:

Planned to optimize dust cart routes using Pandas (e.g., merging stops and times).
Not started, but aligns with HGV experience.

Pawnbroker AI:

Conceptualized to detect fake watches, handbags, art (inspired by wife‚Äôs work at Prestige Pawnbrokers).
On hold, with dataset research planned (e.g., Kaggle).

Areas for Growth:

Polish poker bot with visualizations (e.g., Matplotlib win rate plots) and multi-file merging.
Start route planner with a simple Pandas script.

Prototype pawnbroker AI post-Module 8.

Next Steps:

Run poker bot to share new win rate:
cd src
python parse_hand_history.py
Add pair decision logic when resuming:

pair_win_rate = df[df['is_pair']]['winnings'].apply(lambda x: x > 0).mean()
overall_win_rate = df['winnings'].apply(lambda x: x > 0).mean()
if pair_win_rate > overall_win_rate:
    print("Recommendation: Play pairs more aggressively!")

Portfolio and Networking (6/10)

Achievements:

Clean GitHub repo with poker bot, proper .gitignore, and regular commits.
‚ÄúLearn Python 3‚Äù certificate ready for LinkedIn.

Encouraged to share 100% quiz scores and progress on X (#AI, #Python).

Current State: Poker bot is main project, but README needs updating. No meetup/community engagement yet.

Areas for Growth:

Update README with Codecademy progress and project details.
Post weekly on X, join r/MachineLearning, attend virtual AI meetups.
Create a portfolio site (e.g., GitHub Pages) post-Module 8.

Next Steps:
Update README.md:

- Completed "Learn Python 3" and earned certificate
- 66% through "Data and Programming Foundations for AI" Skill Path
- Aced Pandas Multiple Tables Quiz (100%), mastering DataFrame merging

git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated README with Pandas multi-tables progress"
git push origin master

Career Readiness (5/10)

Achievements:

Clear goal: Switch to AI role (e.g., Junior Data Scientist, $60k-$90k) in 6-12 months.
Transferable skills: HGV/dust cart (logistics, problem-solving), poker (strategy, probability).
Well-chosen learning path (Codecademy AI Skill Path).

Current State: Focused on skill-building, no resume updates or job applications yet.

Areas for Growth:
Update resume with certs, projects, and transferable skills.
Research AI jobs on Indeed/Glassdoor post-Module 6.
Network on LinkedIn/X, comment on #AI posts.

Next Steps:
Add ‚ÄúLearn Python 3‚Äù cert and poker bot to resume.
Explore 5-10 AI job listings to align skills.

Overall Progression: 6.5/10

Summary: You‚Äôre ~50% to being job-ready as an AI developer, with strong technical skills (Python, Pandas) and a solid project (poker bot). At 10-20 hours/week, you could apply for entry-level AI roles by July-October 2025.

Strengths:
Fast learner (100% quiz scores, 66% in Skill Path).
Project-driven (poker bot is portfolio-worthy).
Strong work ethic (coding after 6-day dust cart weeks).
Practical project ideas (route planner, pawnbroker AI).

Areas for Growth:
Learn ML basics and math (Modules 7-8).
Polish portfolio and network.
Start job prep (resume, applications).

Today‚Äôs Plan (2-4 Hours, April 27, 2025)
Codecademy:
Finish "Page Visits Funnel" project (1.5-2 hours): Merge DataFrames, calculate conversion rates.
Start "Data Manipulation Challenge Project" (1-1.5 hours): Load dataset, explore, begin manipulations.
VS Code Practice (tie to projects):

import pandas as pd
hands = pd.DataFrame({
    'hand_id': ['123', '124'],
    'player': ['nickyb123', 'nickyb123'],
    'bets': [20, 50]
})
outcomes = pd.DataFrame({
    'hand_id': ['123', '124'],
    'winnings': [100, -50]
})
merged = pd.merge(hands, outcomes, on='hand_id', how='left')
print(merged[merged['player'] == 'nickyb123'])

Dust Cart Grind: 6-day workweek was intense‚Äîprops for coding after that! üõª

Next Steps
This Week:
Finish Module 6 (Page Visits Funnel, Data Manipulation Challenge).
Start Module 7 (Exploratory Data Analysis).
Share poker bot win rate when resuming.
1-2 Months:

Complete Skill Path (Modules 7-9).
Polish poker bot, start route planner, prep pawnbroker AI.
Network on X, LinkedIn, meetups.

3-6 Months:
Learn ML basics (Coursera‚Äôs ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù).

Update resume, apply to AI jobs.

Consider Google‚Äôs Professional ML Engineer cert.

Keep rocking it, Nick! Save this file and let me know your progress on "Page Visits Funnel" or any questions. You‚Äôre on track for AI dev glory! üöÄ
